        "description" : "Mistral API is a project that utilizes the Mistral AI model to provide a text-based data exploration tool. The project allows users to interact with a database using natural language queries, and Mistral AI model responds with relevant information by calling appropriate functions. The project uses a combination of Python and Mistral AI SDK to create a client that sends messages to the Mistral AI model and receives responses. The project includes several functions that are used to interact with the database and extract relevant information. The current implementation of the project requires manual and local code execution, but it can be modified to automate this process and provide a seamless user experience. Additionally, the project can be improved by adding more functions to handle complex queries and improve the interaction between the database and the Mistral AI model."
